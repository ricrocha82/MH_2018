# Network and machine learning analyses of estuarine microbial communities along a freshwater-marine mixed gradient

This repository contains scripts used to process and analyse the data and to reproduce the figures using 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing data for our paper:

Preprint: [The importance of environmental parameters and mixing zone in shaping estuarine microbial communities along a freshwater-marine gradient](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2022.108026)

## Scripts

The following folders contain scripts for data analysis and figures.

* [scripts](../master/scripts/) contains all scripts to reproduce the analyses and figures (main and supplements).

* [data](../master/data/) contains the processed data used in this paper (otu and taxa tables, meta data, shapefile).


## Data availability 
Raw sequence reads and metadata have been submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under bioproject [PRJNA554530](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA554530/).
